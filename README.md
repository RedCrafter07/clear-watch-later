# clear watch later

This is a small script I wrote for clearing the watch later playlist in YouTube.

## Usage

1. Go to your watch later playlist, usually located [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=WL)
2. Open the console
3. Paste the code found [here](./clear-watch-later.js) ([raw link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedCrafter07/clear-watch-later/refs/heads/main/clear-watch-later.js), simply copy content and paste)
4. If prompted, enter `allow pasting` and repeat step 3 again.
5. Wait. The script does one video per second because of YouTube's rate limits.
6. Done!
